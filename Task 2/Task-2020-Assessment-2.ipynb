    "Creating a Python function called **Dicerolls** that simulates rolling dice. The function is required to return a dictionary with the number of times each possible total face value occurred. [1]. For formatting reference see[2]. All progress was saved using Github [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method used to complete Task 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Numpy package was imported as np to gain access to numpy library. \n",
    "2. D1 & D2 were declared as independant variables to allow the range increase by k times depending on the number of dice rolled.   \n",
    "3. The function ***dicerolls(k)*** declared with return (D1,D2) was created. The Dicerolls function was called using the form dicerolls(k=2) to observe the output to verify the approach taken worked as required. Expected outcome was values 2 and 12. \n",
    "4. ***np.random.default_rng()*** was used to generate random numbers between D1 & D2 inclusive. The expected outcome for ***dicerolls(K=2)*** was a value between 2 & 12 inclusive. [4]\n",
    "5. ***size*** parameter was added to generate the required number of values. This was initially trialed using ***size=2***. The expected outcome was two values ranging between 2 & 12 inclusive. The second parameter 'n' was added to create the function with 2 parameters ***dicerolls(k,n)***. At this point size=2 was replaced by ***size=n***. This would raise the number of value return equal to the numbers of rolls of the dice. \n",

    "Note: Program Iterations are the number of times the program was revised during development.\n",

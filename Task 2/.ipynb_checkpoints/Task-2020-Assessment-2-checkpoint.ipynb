    "Creating a Python function called **Dicerolls** that simulates rolling dice. The function is required to return a dictionary with the number of times each possible total face value occurred. [1]. For formatting reference see[2]. All progress was saved using Github [3].\n",

    "#### Method used to complete Task 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Numpy package was imported as np to gain access to numpy library. \n",
    "2. D1 & D2 were declared as independant variables to allow the range increase by k times depending on the number of dice rolled.   \n",
    "3. The function ***dicerolls(k)*** declared with return (D1,D2) was created. The Dicerolls function was called using the form dicerolls(k=2) to observe the output to verify the approach taken worked was required. Expected outcome was values 2 and 12. \n",
    "4. ***np.random.default_rng()*** was used to generate random numbers between D1 & D2 inclusive. Te expected outcome for ***dicerolls(K=2)*** was a value between 2 & 12 inclusive. [4]\n",

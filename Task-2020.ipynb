    "****\n",
    "Creating a Python Function called **Counts** that takes a list as input and returns a dictionary of unique items in the list as keys and the number of each iteam appears as values. [1]. For formatting reference see [2]. All progress was saved using GitHub [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method used to complete Task 1. \n",
    "1. The variable **Values** was assigned to the elements as outlined in Task 1 of the given assignment. The count function was called to *count* the numbers of times an element appears in the list.[3]. *(Iteration 1 of the python program)*.\n",
    "2. *Value = [ ]* was added to allow input from a user in the form of characters or digits [4]. This input is converted *(split)* from a string into a list [5]. This list is then converted into a dictionary and displayed [6].*(Iteration 1 of the python program)*.\n",

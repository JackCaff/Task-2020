### Task-2020
#### Author: Jack Caffrey
#### Purpose

Repository required to complete the Task 2020 assignments as part of the fundamentals of Data Analysis Module. In order to complete the assignments a total of 4 assessments will need to be completed. These assignments will be completed at different points throughout the duration of the moudule. A combination of "Jupyter" & "Python" will be used to complete the assessments. All reference used will be referenced in the individaul tasks.  

### Tasks Summary:

1. Creating a Python Function called Counts that takes a list as input and returns a dictionary of unique items in the list as keys and the number of each iteam appears as    values.   
2. Creating a Python Function called dicerolls that simulates rolling dice. The function is required to return a dictionary with the number of times each possible total face value occurred.
3. Write some python code thatsimulates flipping a coin 100 times, Then run this code 1,000 times, keeping track of the number of heads in each of the 1,000 simulations. Select an appropriate plot to depict the resulting list of 1,000 numbers, showing that it roughly follows a bell-shaped curve. 
4. Simpson’s paradox is a well-known statistical paradoxwhere a trend evident in a number of groups reverses when the groups are combinedinto one big data set.  Use numpy to create four data sets, each with anxarrayand  a  correspondingyarray,  to  demonstrate  Simpson’s  paradox.
